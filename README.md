# Neural-Network-Optimized-by-PSO
this project integrates - ‚óè Neural Network  and Particle Swarm Optimization together to reduce training time of neural network. this is a fun machine learning experiment. This project analyzes the performance of NN optimized by PSO Replacing Back propagation. This hybrid approach then employed on a disease dataset and classified the diasese successfully. For comparison Purpose other well known approaches have also been implemented here in this project to compare the accuracy as well as efficiency of our model. this project has been implemented in python.
